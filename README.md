# Acknowledgement 
This repository contains the work of Daniel Brockhaus and Intent Software. This repository will not have the complete game files and will be limited to certain files with the intention to represent some of the work I was able to contribute to the open source project. The complete project can be found on lead developer Daniel Brockhaus' website (http://brockhaus.org/astonia3.html).

# Preface
Astonia 3 is a small MMO. It has all the stuff a fantasy role-playing game needs (character development with attributes, skills and spells, quests, equipment and monsters), and it can handle maybe 500 players online at once per shard. A realistic limit for the number of shards is around 50. With some investments into the database server hardware more is possible.

Astonia 3 is the successor to my hobby project Mercenaries of Astonia 2. It was developed mostly by Daniel Brockhaus for Intent Software. Intent Software was so kind to allow Daniel Brockhaus to release the project to the public.
