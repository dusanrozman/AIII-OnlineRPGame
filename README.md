# Acknowledgement 
This repository contains the work of Daniel Brockhaus and *Intent Software*. This repository will not have the complete game files and will be limited to certain files with the intention to try and best represent some of the work I (Dusan Rozman) was able to contribute to the open source project. I have done my best to highlight where possible the additions I have made in attempt to avoid misrepresentation of my work.

Please note: Having worked with several other hobbyist developers, I tried my best to remove any code that was not written by myself or Intent Software out of respect to those individuals. That said, if I missed something and you see your work in these files that you do not wish to be public, please contact me with the file and line numbers and I can work to remove it.

# Preface
Astonia 3 is a small MMO. It has all the stuff a fantasy role-playing game needs (character development with attributes, skills and spells, quests, equipment and monsters), and it can handle maybe 500 players online at once per shard. A realistic limit for the number of shards is around 50. With some investments into the database server hardware more is possible.

Astonia 3 is the successor to my [Daniel Brockhaus'] hobby project Mercenaries of Astonia 2. It was developed mostly by me [Daniel Brockhaus] for Intent Software. Intent Software was so kind to allow me [Daniel Brockhaus] to release the project to the public.

For those interested, the complete project can be found on lead developer Daniel Brockhaus' website (http://brockhaus.org/astonia3.html).
